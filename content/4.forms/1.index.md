So you may be wondering why I have 2 types of forms in this documentation... In all honesty, I was just following the guys that created shadcn-vue lol. The components created here is how I usually go about creating form elements to be used in my projects. I use the composition API provided by `vee-validate` to compose my reusable form elements and then use the `useForm` composable to do the validation with either `zod` or `yup` schemas.

## Installation

In order to get this to work in your app, you will need to install the following packages:

- [Tailwind Forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms)
- [Vee-Validate Nuxt Module](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/integrations/nuxt/)

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms && npm i @vee-validate/nuxt
```

You will also need a library that will be used to perform validation. Since `vee-validate` supports `zod`, `yup`, `valibot` and `joi`, you can choose any of these libraries to perform validation. For this documentation, I will be using `zod` to perform validation.

```bash
npm i zod @vee-validate/zod
```

## Setup

After installing the stuff, we need to add the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin to our `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
// ...
plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/forms")({ strategy: "class" })],
// ...
```

Why the class strategy you ask? Well, I don't want the plugin to override the styles of all my inputs, only the ones I choose to add the `form-*` class to ðŸ˜Š.

After that, we will need to add the `@vee-validate/nuxt` module to our `nuxt.config.js` file.

```js
modules: [
  "@vee-validate/nuxt",
],
```
